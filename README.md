# Binary--to--7-segment-decoder

ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

A Binary to 7-Segment Decoder is a combinational circuit that converts a 4-bit binary input (0-9) into a 7-segment display pattern. Itâ€™s commonly used in digital clocks, counters, and embedded systems to show numeric outputs.

âœ… 7-Segment Display Configuration

A typical 7-segment display has 7 LEDs labeled from a to g, arranged in the following pattern:

    -- a --
    |       |
    f       b
    |       |
    -- g --
    |       |
    e       c
    |       |
    -- d --
